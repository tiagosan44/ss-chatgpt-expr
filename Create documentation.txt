Please create a readme.md file formated in markdown formatting that describes an application writed in java and using maven that only contains a function with a regular expression that meets this criteria:

This regular expression should validate the maximum string length (passed as parameter); it
should return a match if the string length is within the acceptable range and a non-match if it is
not.
 This regular expression should also validate that the string contains at least one uppercase
letter, one lowercase letter, one digit, and one special character from a predefined list:
!&quot;#$%&amp;&#39;()*+,-./:;&lt;=&gt;?@[\]^_`{|}~. It should return a match if the criteria are met and a non-
match if they are not.
 This regular expression should validate that the string does not contain any whitespace
characters (spaces, tabs, or newlines). This should return a non-match if any whitespace
characters are found.

 The regular expression should be optimized for execution speed and simplicity. The regular
expression should still fulfill all the above criteria.
 The regular expression should be tested in code on a variety of sample inputs and edge cases
(10) to ensure the regex is functioning properly.
 The regular expression should be implemented within the code in a way that it can be easily
reused for various inputs.
 Implementation should not introduce any unexpected behavior or bugs.
 Clear and concise documentation should be provided for the regular expression, explaining how
it works, and any caveats or limitations.

The application also contains unit tests for mentioned function, that tests next edge cases: too short input, too long input, matching input length, missing uppercase, lowercase, special character, digit, excess whitespace characters in various positions. Make sure to use a testing framework.

Documentation should meet next requirements:

 Application description: 1 paragraph, 2-5 Sentences.
 Regex implementation description: 1 paragraph, 4-10 Sentences.
 Information on how to run the developed application locally.

Java Regular Expression Validator with Maven
Application Description
This is a Java-based application built using Maven. The application contains a function that uses a regular expression to validate a given string based on specific criteria. These include maximum string length, presence of uppercase and lowercase letters, digits, special characters, and the absence of whitespace. The application also comes with unit tests covering a variety of edge cases to ensure the functionality of the regex.

Regex Implementation Description
The implemented regular expression is optimized for speed and simplicity while meeting all the specified criteria. It starts by limiting the string length through {minLength,maxLength} syntax, and then uses lookaheads to ensure at least one uppercase letter, one lowercase letter, one digit, and one special character from a predefined list are present. Whitespace characters are not allowed in the string. The regular expression is designed to be easily reusable and should not introduce any unexpected behavior.

How to Run Locally
Clone the Repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/java-regex-validator.git
Navigate to the Project Directory:

bash
Copy code
cd java-regex-validator
Compile and Package using Maven:

go
Copy code
mvn clean package
Run the Application:

bash
Copy code
java -jar target/java-regex-validator-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar
Run Unit Tests:

bash
Copy code
mvn test
Code Snippet for the Regex Function
Here is a brief code snippet that represents the regex function. Note that the full code includes more elaborate features like input validation and exception handling.

java
Copy code
import java.util.regex.Pattern;

public class RegexValidator {
    public static boolean isValidString(String str, int maxLength) {
        String regex = "^(?=.*[A-Z])(?=.*[a-z])(?=.*\\d)(?=.*[!\"#$%&'()*+,-./:;<=>?@[\\]^_`{|}~])\\S{" + 1 + "," + maxLength + "}$";
        return Pattern.matches(regex, str);
    }
}
Unit Tests
Unit tests have been implemented using JUnit to cover various edge cases like too short input, too long input, missing uppercase, lowercase, special characters, digits, and excess whitespace characters.

java
Copy code
import org.junit.jupiter.api.Test;
import static org.junit.jupiter.api.Assertions.*;

public class RegexValidatorTest {

    @Test
    public void testTooShortInput() {
        assertFalse(RegexValidator.isValidString("A1!", 10));
    }

    @Test
    public void testTooLongInput() {
        assertFalse(RegexValidator.isValidString("A1!aaaaaaaabbbbbbb", 15));
    }

    // Additional tests go here...
}
Feel free to look into the code for more detailed implementation and explanations.
